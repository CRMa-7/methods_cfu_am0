# Self-Evaluation

1. Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I am most proud of my perseverance. There were many times I wanted to give up, but I utilized my resources and made it through!
2. What is the power of using methods in our applications?
- Methods are little bundles of instructions that tell your application what to do when bits of information are input. Defining your own methods can help you solve unique problems in the application you are building.
